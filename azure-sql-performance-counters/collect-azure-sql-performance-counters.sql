/*
DESCRIPTION:
This script collects SQL performance counter values from sys.dm_os_performance_counters DMV.
It is intended for Azure SQL Database performance monitoring and diagnostic data collection,
where the traditional methods of collecting PerfMon data are not available.

The script will execute for the specified number of iterations, which can be set to a large number for 
a quasi-indefinite capture similar to default PerfMon behavior. At the beginning of each iteration, a
snapshot of cumulative counters is taken, followed by a wait interval, and then by a second snapshot.
At that time, counter values are recorded in the dbo.perf_counter_log table, and a new iteration starts.

USAGE:
1. Set the @SnapshotIntervalSeconds and @MaxIterationCount parameters. 
2. Optionally, edit the script (specifically the INSERT INTO @SourceCounter statement) to define the counters to be collected.
3. Run the script.
4. Collected data will be found in dbo.perf_counter_log table in the current database.
